## Skills Derived from Amplifier Agents

**From knowledge-archaeologist agent:**
- tracing-knowledge-lineages - Understanding how ideas evolved over time to find old solutions for new problems and avoid repeating past failures

## What Was Adapted

The knowledge-archaeologist agent excels at temporal analysis of knowledge evolution, paradigm shift documentation, and preserving the "fossil record" of ideas. This skill extracts the core research techniques for understanding why current approaches exist before proposing changes.

Adapted with practical search strategies (decision records, git archaeology, conversation history) and scoped for mature codebases (explicitly notes to skip for greenfield projects).
